# Blockchain-Based Voting System

## Overview
A decentralized blockchain-based voting system using Hyperledger Fabric. Voters can securely cast their votes, and results are stored transparently on the blockchain.

## Technologies Used
- **Hyperledger Fabric** (Smart Contract & Ledger)
- **Node.js & Express.js** (Backend API)
- **React.js** (Frontend UI)
- **Docker & Kubernetes** (For deployment)

## How to Run
1. **Setup Hyperledger Fabric network**
2. **Deploy the smart contract (`voting.go`)**
3. **Start the backend server (`server.js`)**
4. **Run the frontend (`App.js`)**

## Features
- Secure and tamper-proof voting.
- Transparent result aggregation.
- Decentralized & immutable ledger.

## Future Enhancements
- Mobile app integration.
- Biometric voter authentication.
